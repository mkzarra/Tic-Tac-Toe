 Planning stradegy:
    -Create tic-tac-toe game working locally
    -created wireframes and user stories
    -add authentication
    -use api to persist games
    -pseudocode
    
 Problem solving:
  -used Developer tools to investigate issues
  -researched ways to implement technologies
  -colaberated with other developers to broaden my thought process
 
 Unsolved Problems:
  -api requests
  -styling
  -bonuses
  
Wireframes and user stories:
  -   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

[Wireframe2](https://github.com/mkzarra/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/dev/IMG_20180621_162651373.jpg)
-   The data structure you plan to use.
the game is represented as an array
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
using event handlers and assigning a boolean value to x and o
i'm not totally sure how it will also be looking for the path of 3 consecutive equal boolean values
-   How you plan to approach this project.
I will create pseudo code between each step. I will make the html first and then work on the js logic. css/sass will be last.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
the game does not allow a value to be overwritten in the DOM
the game requires a basic login flow
the game has a reset board function
the game keeps score until player signs out
the game ends the players turn when a space is selected.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
i plan on using the GA model for js and sass
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
score board until one player signs out.
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
multiple branches and frequent commits
-   What additional features will you build if you have extra time?
ultimate tic-tac-toe?
